# Game Design Document

## 1. Product Identity

Tiny Factory is a compact, playful, readable factory-incremental game. Players roll for machines and arrange them into visible production chains.

The game's strongest possible player story is:

> “I rolled something weird, rebuilt my line around it, and discovered a much better setup.”

The game should reward experimentation more than passive waiting.

## 2. Design Status Legend

- **Current Design** — intended for v1.00 unless removed by testing.
- **Planned Design** — intended for a later validated version.
- **Speculative** — possible future direction; not approved scope.

## 3. Core Loop — Current Design

Produce → transform → sell → earn → roll → decide → rebuild → expand → repeat.

The loop succeeds when players repeatedly make **layout decisions**, not merely wait for an upgrade button.

## 4. Factory Building — Current Design

v1.00 uses a deliberately constrained building model:

- one player plot
- one logical production route
- fixed or semi-fixed conveyor backbone
- machine slots on a grid
- place / move / rotate / remove
- short interaction distances and obvious snapping
- no unrestricted Factorio-style conveyor graph

The recommended v1.00 implementation is a **fixed-path slot system** or **grid slots along a predefined route**. It is faster to build, easier to save, easier to use on mobile, and still proves whether machine ordering is fun.

### Planned

v2.00 may introduce:

- modular conveyor pieces
- branches
- splitters
- mergers
- sorters
- multiple lines
- copy/move tools

Only after v1.00 proves that players care about rebuilding.

## 5. Item Production — Current Design

A production item should contain only gameplay-relevant state:

- item archetype / shape
- base value
- current value
- visual material/color state
- size scalar if required
- compact modifier flags/tags when necessary
- source producer ID for analytics

Do not persist transient conveyor items.

Items visually travel through the factory. Simulation should not depend on unrestricted Roblox physics.

## 6. Conveyors — Current Design

Conveyors primarily communicate item motion.

Recommended implementation:

- deterministic path movement
- anchored or non-colliding visual items
- server-authoritative logical progress
- client-supported interpolation/effects where safe
- hard cap on active items per factory

The conveyor is not a physics sandbox.

## 7. Machine Interactions — Current Design

Each processor should create a visible, understandable change.

Initial machine categories should focus on a few distinct decisions:

- producers
- direct value modifiers
- physical/visual modifiers
- one duplication-style mechanic
- one risk/randomness mechanic
- utility/speed
- seller

Machine order should matter where it creates understandable strategy.

Example:

- Giantifier before a size-sensitive multiplier can be stronger than the reverse.
- A Duplicator placed before an expensive transformation creates additional processing demand.
- A speed booster can improve throughput only when downstream machines can keep up.

Avoid opaque interactions that require a wiki during the first release.

## 8. RNG — Current Design

RNG determines which machine option appears, but the player should keep agency.

v1.00 recommended model:

- Coins buy a roll.
- A roll returns one machine or, if implementation cost remains low, a **choice of three**.
- Duplicate machines are allowed.
- Unwanted machines can be sold for a partial Coin refund.
- A lightweight pity or bad-luck protection system may exist if test data shows streak frustration.

Do not sell real-money luck or rare rolls in v1.00.

## 9. Rarity — Current Design

Initial rarity ladder:

- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic
- Legendary

Rarity communicates acquisition frequency and mechanical unusualness, not guaranteed universal superiority.

A low-rarity machine can remain useful because of:

- low processing delay
- specific tags
- synergy
- compact footprint
- predictable behavior
- favorable throughput

## 10. Initial Machine Set — Current Design

Target **12 machines** for first serious validation, with a ceiling of roughly 15 if the extra machines clearly create new decisions.

Suggested launch set:

### Producers
1. Basic Dropper
2. Fast Dropper
3. Heavy Dropper

### Core Modifiers
4. Value Stamper
5. Giantifier
6. Paint Machine
7. Compound Press

### Utility / Flow
8. Conveyor Booster
9. Cooldown Tuner

### Special
10. Duplicator
11. Goldenizer
12. Lucky Modifier

### Seller
The seller is infrastructure, not necessarily a rolled machine in v1.00.

This list is a design starting point, not a promise. Remove any machine that does not create a meaningful choice.

## 11. Progression — Current Design

v1.00 progression consists of:

- Coins
- machine inventory growth
- a small number of factory capacity upgrades
- production milestones
- discovery of machine types

No prestige is required.

### Planned

v3.00 may add:

- collection completion
- research
- factory tiers
- challenge tracks
- persistent specialization
- conditional prestige if reset-based play has a clear strategic purpose

## 12. Economy — Current Design

Use **Coins only** in v1.00.

Coins pay for:

- machine rolls
- limited factory capacity upgrades

Unwanted machines return a fraction of their effective roll value.

The economy must keep players rebuilding rather than waiting for exponential passive accumulation.

## 13. Factory Expansion — Current Design

Use a few capacity steps, such as:

- initial slots
- one affordable early extension
- one mid-session extension
- one later-session extension

Expansion should increase design possibility, not simply floor size.

## 14. UX — Current Design

A new player should immediately understand:

- where items originate
- where they travel
- what machines do
- where value changes
- where items are sold
- current Coins
- how to roll
- how to place a machine

Machine cards/tooltips should show:

- name
- rarity
- category
- one-sentence effect
- key number(s)
- basic compatibility warning if relevant

Avoid giant stat sheets.

## 15. Visual Direction — Current Design

Style:

- compact
- toy-like
- colorful
- chunky
- mechanical
- readable
- slightly chaotic

Examples of visual communication:

- Duplicator physically splits an item
- Goldenizer recolors it with a metallic flash
- Giantifier enlarges it
- Value Stamper visibly stamps a number/icon
- Seller pulls the item in and emits a Coin burst

Effects should reinforce state changes without obscuring the line.

## 16. Audio — Current Design

Use short, layered feedback:

- drop sound
- conveyor hum
- machine activation
- transformation accent
- rare-machine roll stinger
- sale/coin confirmation
- placement/move sounds

Avoid constant overlapping noise from every machine.

## 17. Mobile — Current Design

v1.00 must support mobile building.

Requirements:

- large machine selection cards
- placement preview
- obvious valid/invalid state
- tap to select
- drag or guided slot selection
- rotate button rather than precision gesture dependence
- easy cancel
- no tiny hit targets

## 18. Multiplayer — Current Design

Players may share a server, but each factory remains independently functional.

v1.00 does not require:

- cooperation
- trading
- shared production
- competition

Other players can be visible without becoming a dependency.

## 19. Monetization Principles — Current Design

Do not monetize the validation question.

Avoid in v1.00:

- paid luck
- premium-only machines
- direct production multipliers
- paid reroll pressure
- gambling-like machine purchase loops

### Planned / Conditional

Safer future options:

- factory themes
- machine skins
- conveyor skins
- decorative props
- cosmetic item trails
- UI themes
- supporter cosmetics

## 20. Long-Term Possibilities — Speculative

Only if earlier versions validate:

- multiple factory worlds
- player blueprint sharing
- co-op mega-factories
- seasonal machine sets
- server production goals
- advanced research
- sophisticated automation
- trading/marketplace
- clan factories

None are current commitments.

## 21. Design Kill Tests

A proposed feature should be rejected or deferred if:

- it works without interacting with the factory
- it makes layout order less meaningful
- it adds a currency without a unique economic purpose
- it invalidates most existing machines
- it requires excessive UI management
- it causes major performance cost for minor gameplay value
- it makes spending more important than factory decisions
- it primarily imitates generic Roblox simulator conventions
